This repository will hold general scripts for various titles, such as Pok√©mon Crystal and Mobile Trainer. Ensure that, on your server, Windows line encodings are used to ensure the Game Boy Color can correctly read index files.

## Setup

- Set your server root to the webroot folder, and the base to the html folder (if using Apache, `DocumentRoot /path/to/webroot/html`).
- Edit core-example.php for your server id (must be 4 characters) and domain, as well as your MySQL username/pass/db.
- Ensure all index.txt files use Windows line returns; on Unix systems, use `unix2dos` to do this.
