This repository will hold general scripts for various titles, such as Pok√©mon Crystal and Mobile Trainer. Ensure that, on your server, Windows line encodings are used to ensure the Game Boy Color can correctly read index files.

## Setup

- Set your server root correctly to the webroot/html folder. An example nginx config is supplied, but this should work with Apache as well.
- Edit core-example.php for your server id (must be 4 characters) and domain, as well as your MySQL username/pass/db.
- Ensure all index.txt files use Windows line returns; on Unix systems, use `unix2dos` to do this.
